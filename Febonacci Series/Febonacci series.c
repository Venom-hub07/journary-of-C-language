/*
* This code defines a function `main` in the C programming language. 
* It initializes variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i`. It then prints the values of `a` and `b` using the `printf` function. 
* The code prompts the user to input a value for `n` using the `scanf` function. 
* A `for` loop is used to perform a sequence of calculations. 
* Inside the loop, the value of `c` is calculated as the sum of `a` and `b`.
* The value of `a` is then updated to the current value of `b`, and the value of `b` is updated to the current value of `c`. 

* The loop continues for `n` iterations.
